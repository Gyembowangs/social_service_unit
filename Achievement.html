                <p>In response to a request from Choekhortse Shedra, the Social Service Unit (SSU) successfully completed the whitewashing of the Kanglung Thupten Choekhorling Dingrem Shedra Chorten (བཀང་ལུང་ཐུབ་བསྟན་ཆོས་འཁོར་གླིང་འབྲིང་རིམ་བཤད་གྲྭ) on a Sunday.

                <p>A group of 32 dedicated individuals, under guidance of four lecturer and the leadership of SSU Coordinator and Mathametic forum generously dedicated their weekend on the 14th and 15th of October to actively participate in the construction of a monastery located in Moshi, within the Lumang Gewog of Trshigang. Their journey commenced at 5 AM, and they reached their destination at approximately 8 AM. Their service officially began at 9 AM, where they selflessly contributed to the construction efforts of Moshi Lhakhang.
                    On the first day, their responsibilities included the transportation of vital materials such as sand, gravel, and poles, all of which were essential for the construction of the monastery's kitchen.
                    On the second day, they continued their dedicated work, adhering to the same routine, but with the additional task of unloading bricks.
                    The service at Moshi Lhakhang concluded on a spiritually uplifting note, with the contributors receiving blessings from Khentrul Sangay Tenzin Rinpoche.</p>

                <p>On the 11th of April, 2023, a representative from the Social Service Unit collaborated with English teachers from Autsho Namdroling Dratshang to engage in a comprehensive discussion aimed at designing a tailored English curriculum for the learners within the Dratshang. This productive dialogue spanned approximately three and a half hours and took place at the Dratshang's IT lab.
                    The primary agenda for this discussion revolved around the development of a specific English learning curriculum, tailored to meet the unique needs of the monks within the Dratshang. The curriculum's key emphasis will be on enhancing their speaking and writing skills. It is envisioned that this new curriculum will significantly contribute to making the learning of English a more accessible and effective endeavor for the Dratshang's learners.
                    Crucially, the design and implementation of this curriculum will be a collaborative effort between the Social Service Unit and the English teachers from the Dratshang. This joint initiative highlights the commitment to providing valuable educational resources and opportunities for the monks, thereby fostering their language skills and facilitating their overall growth and development.</p>
